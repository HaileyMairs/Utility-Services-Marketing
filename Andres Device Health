NOTE FOR TEAM — DEVICE HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
------------------------------------------
You will MOST LIKELY see **no results** from both:

    get_battery_health()
    get_offline_devices()

This is NOT an error in the code.

Reason:
The table I wrote queries against — dbo.DeviceBatteryHistory —
does NOT exist in our MCRWS-Telog database provided to us.
It was a placeholder name because the real voltage / battery tables
were never identified or included in the data drop.

Because of that:
    • queries safely return []
    • the GUI will show an empty table
    • this is expected and NOT a malfunction

If the client provides the real battery/voltage history table later,
we can plug it in and these functions will immediately work.

Just letting everyone know so the team doesn’t think this section is broken.
